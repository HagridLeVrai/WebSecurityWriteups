# WebSecurity Project Write-up

With this project we discovered the common security vulnerabilities encountered on the Web & their consequences. We have learned to analyze a web serverâ€™s behavior in order to exploit it.

## During this challenge we saw:

- Basic cryptography & encoding knowledge
  - Base64
  - Hashes
  - Basic encryption principles (Symmetric / Asymmetric Cryptography)
- Knowledge of various common security mechanisms:
  - CSRF Tokens
  - JWT
  - Input Sanitization
  - Password Storage Best Practices
- Knowledge of some common weaknesses:
  - XSS
  - SQLi
  - LFI
- Basic usage of various important tools
  - Burp
  - Curl
  - nmap
